# Submission Notes

- **NO MORE THAN 1 SITE PER REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED**
  - it's easy enough to make multiple requests, and it helps.
  - if you have a huge batch, contact the editor.
- Check that the site is up and the link works
  - if the onion site is down, the site will not be added / may be removed from the list; no exceptions.
- HTTP and/or HTTPS only
  - check for SSL availability, upgrade to that if available and add a :lock: emoji.
- Structure
  - SecureDrop in the SecureDrop section *NO EXCEPTIONS*
  - GlobaLeaks in the GlobaLeaks section *NO EXCEPTIONS*
  - only SD and GL sites take a "proof" URL
  - maintain alphabetical sorting for entries
  - elide leading "The" from sitenames
  - stick to the existing categories
  - onion site comes first in listings
- Contact the editor for anything more complex than a simple update.

## Main Lists

Pull requests for the main list will be accepted only for entries of the form:

```
## Sitename
* <url of onion> [<lock emoji if https>] [<site notes, four words max>]
...

[(site note in parentheses)]
```

If there are many onions, submit a few, key, ones, plus an "index"
page for the others. The "index" page *must* be an onion site, and
*must* be followed with a sub-bullet for its cleartext equivalent; see
existing examples for precedent.

If the `Sitename` is an acronym, append `/ <acronym spelled out>`

If the site is locally scoped or an umbrella for several
organisations, consider appending `(.cc; <notes>)` where `cc` is the
ISO 2-letter country code.

## Drops & Leaks

Pull requests for the SecureDrop or GlobaLeaks lists will be accepted
only for entries of the form:

```
## Publication, Site *or* Journalist Name [ / 1..4 word description ]
* <url of onion> <lock emoji if https>
* <first-party "proof" url citing the above url>
```

## Don't have a GitHub account?

GitHub and the online editor at:

* https://github.com/alecmuffett/onion-sites-that-dont-suck/blob/master/README.md

...are certainly the fastest and most effective way to submit a
suggestion.

If you lack that, then try `@alecmuffett` on Twitter.
